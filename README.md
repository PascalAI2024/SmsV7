# Stuck On Traffic - SMS Campaign Manager

## Project Overview
A specialized SMS campaign management platform designed to comply with SMS regulations by enabling manual message sending while providing enterprise-level campaign management features. The system enforces manual sending to comply with regulations while maintaining high efficiency through gamification and performance tracking.

### Performance Metrics
Based on real-world testing:
- 50 taps in 10 seconds = 300 messages per minute
- 6 intervals of 10 seconds per minute = 300 messages/minute
- 300 messages/minute × 42 minutes = 12,600 messages/hour
- Accounting for human factors: ~10,000 messages/hour sustainable rate

## SMS Sending Calculations

### Base Metrics
- Target: 50 taps per 10-second interval
- 6 intervals per minute (60 seconds)
- 42 minutes of active sending per hour (allowing for breaks)

### Hourly Calculations
1. Per 10-second interval:
   - 50 messages sent
   - Requires consistent tapping rhythm

2. Per Minute:
   - 6 intervals × 50 messages = 300 messages
   - Sustainable with proper pacing

3. Per Hour:
   - Theoretical maximum: 300 messages × 60 minutes = 18,000
   - Realistic target: 10,000-12,000 accounting for:
     - Natural breaks
     - Rhythm variations
     - Human fatigue factors

### Optimization Strategies
- Maintain consistent 10-second interval rhythm
- Use achievement system for motivation
- Track performance metrics in real-time
- Implement combo system for sustained performance
- Regular short breaks to maintain efficiency
